## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Node.js gulp


### What I learned

Working with grid template areas. Makes placing items in your grid a snap!
Started a SASS/SCSS library. Made custon functions to create my own utility/breakpoint/color and grid classes.

### Continued development

Continue to add-on custom classes using SASS.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kqN4hl9bGc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jxJX7vojNVK-o8ubDZEcNb&index=1) - Learned how to create a custom css library. 
Kevin Powell - again, his CSS videos are some of the best explanations available.
